# UE4DocTool
A UE4 plugin that creates documentation pages for UE4 projects, plugins and engines.

Examples of what it can do: https://freshmutroom.github.io/UE4DocTool/

To use this application requires the following:
- Windows 10 (small chance 7/8/8.1 will work)
- Visual Studio 2019 (2017 might work)
- Only works with UE4.23, UE4.24 and UE4.25 projects/plugins. In addition the engine version corrisponding to the engine association of your project must be installed (e.g. to document a 4.24 project will require UE4.24 to be installed)
- Pages it creates have been tested in Google Chrome. Other browsers might display correctly but unlikely
